# GTK and Python for Windows

This project builds the Python and GTK framework for BleachBit
to use on Microsoft Windows. This includes introspection support
and a PyGObject wheel. Consistent with PyPI packaging practices, we
use Microsoft Visual C++ and vcpkg instead of gcc and MSYS2.

As of 2026-05-10, this project builds:
* Python 3.12.13
* GTK 3.24.52
* PyGObject 3.56.3
* Pango 1.57.1
* Fontconfig 2.17.1
* HarfBuzz 14.2.0

The build environment is GitHub Actions with MSVC++ 2022.
For more information about the build environment and build
process, see the [GitHub Action YAML files](https://github.com/bleachbit/pygtkwin/tree/main/.github/workflows)
or [logs](https://github.com/bleachbit/pygtkwin/actions).

Perhaps you are looking for a PyGTK all in one (AIO) installer,
but the others you found were years out of date? If you need to
run GTK on Windows, try this repository plus the
[install script](https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit/blob/master/windows/python-gtk3-install.ps1)
from the BleachBit repository.

## Viewing run status and logs

Use the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://github.com/cli/cli/).

List recent runs:

```
$ gh run list

View the log for a specific run. Recent versions of `gh` stream the log
directly without downloading it first; if the command fails, upgrade `gh`.
